Below is a complete, refactored version of your `sidebar.jsx` that incorporates the suggested improvements:

- **DRY and Reusability:**  
  An array of sidebar items is used to generate the links, and a common class string is defined to avoid repeating the same Tailwind CSS classes.

- **Semantic HTML and Accessibility:**  
  The links are wrapped inside a `<nav>` element with an appropriate `aria-label` for better screen reader support.

- **Improved Routing and Logout Handling:**  
  Instead of using `window.location.replace`, the `useNavigate` hook from React Router is used for a smoother SPA experience.

- **Clear Naming and Readability:**  
  The component is organized and easy to update when adding new links or changing styles.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Link, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const SideBar = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const API = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

  const handleLogout = () => {
    localStorage.removeItem("token");
    navigate(API);
  };

  const sidebarItems = [
    { to: "/admin/", label: "Dashboard" },
    { to: "/admin/student", label: "Students" },
    { to: "/admin/course", label: "Courses" },
    { to: "/admin/course-upload", label: "Upload Courses" },
    { to: "/admin/department", label: "Allocate" },
    { to: "/admin/professors", label: "Faculty" },
    { to: "/admin/logs", label: "Logs" },
    { to: "/admin/feedback", label: "Feedback" },
    { to: "/admin/archived-feedback", label: "Archived Feedback" },
  ];

  const commonClasses =
    "bg-[#3dafaa] p-2 h-16 hover:bg-[rgb(50,140,135)] focus:bg-[rgb(50,140,135)] text-white font-bold";

  return (
    <div className="bg-[#3dafaa] h-screen text-center max-w-[95%] mt-4">
      <nav className="flex flex-col" aria-label="Sidebar Navigation">
        {sidebarItems.map((item, index) => (
          <React.Fragment key={index}>
            <Link to={item.to} className={commonClasses}>
              {item.label}
            </Link>
            <hr className="border-t-2" />
          </React.Fragment>
        ))}
        <button className={commonClasses} onClick={handleLogout}>
          Logout
        </button>
        <hr className="border-t-2" />
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SideBar;
```

### Explanation

1. **DRY and Reusability:**  
   The sidebar items are stored in an array (`sidebarItems`), and each is rendered using the `.map()` function. This reduces redundancy and simplifies future updates.

2. **Semantic and Accessible HTML:**  
   Wrapping the links and button inside a `<nav>` element with `aria-label="Sidebar Navigation"` helps assistive technologies identify the navigation region.

3. **Routing and Logout Handling:**  
   The `useNavigate` hook from React Router replaces `window.location.replace` for smoother navigation within a single-page application. This method maintains state and leverages React Routerâ€™s built-in transitions.

4. **Styling Improvements:**  
   All common styles are stored in the `commonClasses` variable. This centralizes your styling, making it easier to modify in one place.

This revised code should be more maintainable, accessible, and aligned with best practices for React and modern JavaScript development.
